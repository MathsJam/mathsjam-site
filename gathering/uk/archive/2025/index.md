This is a list of talks to be given at the 2025 MathsJam Gathering. This ordering is provisional and subject to change.

## Saturday

### Session 1a - 13:30-14:10

#### MathsJam Team: Welcome to MathsJam

Introduction and welcome

#### Tiago Hirth: Micro Maths Magic Marvels

This year, 2025, we, Pedro Freitas, Jorge Nuno Silva, Alexandre Silva, and Tiago Hirth, got our book "Magic, Mathematics, and Playing Cards" published. In this five minute presentation I aim to share four quick effects to hook the audience in wanting to know more about the mathematics that make them work to promote our work.

#### Robin Houston: Cool shapes made by intersecting prisms

I’ll explain how to make a family of nice shapes – the rhombic dodecahedron and its stellations – by intersecting prisms; and I will invite you the audience to experiment with variations on the theme.

#### Brigitte Stenhouse: From Sanskrit to Nepali: The mathematical poetry of the Dhananjayas

In the early twentieth century, two Nepali translations were published of Lilavati, a classic Sanskrit maths text. Despite the attribution of one text to Chandrakala Dhananjaya and the other to her husband, Tikaram, the books’ contents reveal that both authors contributed to both texts. In the absence of further documentary evidence, we explore why collaboration was needed to translate Sanskrit mathematical poetry into Nepali. 

#### David Budd: Polyomino Collinearity

How a competition from last year called Dots on a Tiling sent me down a joyful rabbit hole

#### Sujata B Sharma: Plot Twist : When data changes its story!

Some truths vanish when you mix data, others appear when you filter it. Join four paradoxes that expose the drama between numbers, context, and belief.

### Session 1b - 14:40-15:20: 40mins

#### Jørn Hafver: Rock Rock Paper Rock Scissors Paper

We discovered some cool maths magic tricks at G4G Europe this year and played around with them. We think at least some of you will enjoy them, and the challenge of figuring them out. This one makes use of rock paper scissors, not as a handgame, but as a tool to predict secrets.

#### Philipp Reinhard: The Nightking doing some magic

There are knight tours and king tours, and magic squares. Let's give them a mix.

#### Olov Wilander: Breaking the Ice – Relativistically!?

How much energy is there in an ice cube? Einstein says: a lot! But can we relate this to some everyday process, like melting some ice? Join me in an attempt to understand mass-energy equivalence by means of some simple, but quite imprecise, calculations.

#### Anindya Sharma: The Shape of Our Notes

Three mathematicians gathered in a room and discussed how they structured their (digital) maths notes. This led to a fun exploration of some pleasing structures, and a couple of nice metaphors for other parts of life.

#### Katie Steckles: Fridge Magnet Equations

Katie will share a number of enjoyable equations which can be made using fridge magnets.


#### Session 1c - 15:50-16:30

#### John Read: Can AI’s play Set ?

Our MathsJam group tried asking a large language model to find valid Set solutions. This is what happened.

#### Tarim: The Top 3 Laws in Physics

The number one law in physics might surprise you - let's see if you agree by the end of the talk.

#### David Lyford-Tilley: Fair coins, logical abduction, and sea monsters

Have we been thinking about logic all wrong? David explores some classic scenarios and common errors - and argues for why we should change how we talk about probability and reasoning.

#### Izzy Whistlecroft: The Art of Logic Puzzles

A look into the world of logic puzzles beyond traditional sudoku, with example puzzles of a variety of types. Let's see some cool puzzles!

#### Gavan Fantom: Using maths to bend the world to your will

Much of the history of maths is intertwined with its use as a language to describe how the real world works. But why stop there, when we can also use maths to define how we want the world to work, and to make it so?

### Session 1d - 17:00-18:00

#### Phil Ramsden: Cycling in a Polygonal Rabbit-Hole

Two MathsJams ago, I saw a great talk by John Hoskinson about "diffy polygons", which sent me down a fascinating rabbit-hole. What happens if you put some non-negative integers at the vertices of a square, and then put the mods of their differences at the midpoints of the sides, and use those as a fresh set of vertices, and then continue...? Is the answer to that question always more or less the same? And what if you use a triangle, or a hexagon, or something instead? 

As John was speaking, I started writing code to explore all this, and at first I couldn't work out why it seemed, in certain circumstances, to hang. So over the next few months, I pushed a bit harder and dug a bit deeper, and found out some properly surprising stuff, which I couldn't wait to tell MathsJam about in 2024. 

Then, well, I missed the talks deadline. Turns out I *could* wait! So: a year later than originally planned, here's my report from the "diffy polygons" rabbit hole; I hope you find it as delightful a place as I have.

#### Annette Margolis aka nettie: The Formula for the Derivative of an Inverse Function is 'Tidy' 

If Nessa from 'Gavin & Stacey' were a mathematician, this talk aims to demonstrate that this would be her favourite formula.

#### James (Mr AJ Phillips): A Wikipedia for Open Source Sims & Games

Playing a game from WikiSim.org, a new platform for making quirky to serious open source games about complex (usually the non-maths kind) problems we can understand and solve with maths

#### Bob Huxley: Non-Abelian Jigsaws

How difficult are 3-D jigsaws?

#### Simon Allen: Did the dissection of triangle to a square originate with H. E. Dudeney

A review of the origin of the dissection of an equilateral triangle into a square, which was publicised by H. E. Dudeney. Was he the originator of this?

#### Rob Eastaway: Boethius Blows It

In a famous woodcut from 1503, Boethius demonstrates the new art of how to do arithmetic with Indo Arabic numerals. It's his big moment on the world stage. But he messes up!

#### Saturday Night Tables: Elevator Pitches

Find out about the activities taking place this evening. Each person organising a table activity gets 30 seconds to pitch it to you.

## Sunday

### Session 2a - 9:30-10:10

#### Miles Gould: Dual numbers

Like the complex numbers, the dual numbers are 2D vectors of real numbers with a rule that allows you to multiply them together. But the multiplication rule is different - instead of i² = -1, we have ε² = 0. Why was this rule chosen? And why are some chip vendors building instructions for dual-number arithmetic into their chips?

#### Zoe Griffiths : ONS Baby Names 

Zoe summarises mathematical fun that she's has with the ONS Baby Names data. 

#### Belgin Seymenoglu: Wandering the immeasurable at CERN

Belgin finds a chronological list of formulae on one side of CERN's metallic sculpture, "Wandering the immeasurable".

#### Ally Stanley: All Lines All Ways

The London Underground is made up of 11 train lines. How quickly can you ride one stop on each of them? How many ways can you even do it? I tried them all so you don't have to.

#### David Hartburn: Fretting about rockin'

Last year I bought a guitar tool, a fret rocker. The talk goes into why it is the shape it is, and the maths behind a guitar fretboard.

### Session 2b - 10:40-11:20

#### Fredrik Motland Kirkemo: New advances in the field of clown studies

We discovered some cool maths magic tricks at G4G Europe this year and played around with them. We think at least some of you will enjoy them, and the challenge of figuring them out.

This one pertains to the study of permutations in clown wear and how to predict the colourings of corydonic garments.

#### Niall Cardin: Getting your own Alpha Go to work

Do you want to write a program to play your favourite abstract board game? The AlphaGo paper and others tell you how to do it and it's not as hard as you might think! Still, there are many little details to overcome, from network design to efficient MCTS and figuring out generation of your code and models really play better -- if you don't get these right it won't play that well. 

I will talk through a few of the tricky things I found interesting while writing a program to play the game hex.

#### Matthew Scroggs: 2025 squares

2025 is the sum of the first 9 cube numbers and also the square of the sum of the first nine numbers. You could represent this fact by arranging one 1 by 1 square, two 2 by 2 squares, three 2 by 2 squares, and so on up to nine 9 by 9 squares inside a 45 by 45 square. I'll be talking about this arrangement puzzle, whether or not its possible and whether or not its fun.

### Ashleigh Ratcliffe: Odd one out

This talk is about weighing items where all but one of the items have identical weight. My interest in this puzzle was ignited by one of the questions in the Leiden Math Trail. 

#### Martin Whitworth: How large is a piece of paper?

Paper comes in standard sizes, mostly irrational.  I'll explore the basis of these and other sizes and what you can do with them.

### Session 2c - 11:50-12:30

#### Laurence O'Toole: K(Not) String Theory

Rational tangles, now with Lego minifigures. No pre-training required.

#### Kristin Ohlmann: Optimizing the street safety of a unicycle through maths-inspired decorations

Bikes famously have reflectors to ensure visibility in traffic. My unicycle doesn't. This talk will be about how I fixed that, what pi and tau have to do with it, and which one wins the little competition I put them through!

#### Michael Borcherds: Something I made with my 3D printer

I found a neat way to 3D-print my favourite object

#### Ben Handley: Multinomial skittles

Building on Clare Wallace's talks during the previous two MathsJams, I will try to explain why we get more collisions than predicted (and fewer extreme results).

#### Competition Results

Find out who has won the competitions in the Competition Competition, and which competition has won the Competition Competition.


### Session 2d - 13:30-14:30

#### Vanessa Madu: On Sequences of Semiprimes

Semi-primes, but not even. What an odd thing to do.

#### Barney Maunder-Taylor: Puzzling Pyramids

Exploring some beautiful and unexpected relationships between triangular & square based pyramids.

#### Raphael Colman: Knitted monads

What happens when you pair knitting with Haskell?

#### Harlan Connor: The iterated prisoner's dillemma or: how I learnt to stop worrying and love the bin

We present a comprehensive socioeconomic, game theoretic, and microeconomic examination of a single case study: trying to get a household bin in Liverpool.

#### Nancy Blachman: Mathematical Magic

Mathematical magic has its own curious charm. It delights, confounds, and entices audiences to think about how the trick works.

#### Colin Wright: The Algebraic Pentagon

Complex Numbers meet Compass and Straight-Edge
