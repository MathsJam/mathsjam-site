				Tiago Hirth: Micro Maths Magic Marvels
			</h4>
			<p>
				This year, 2025, we, Pedro Freitas, Jorge Nuno Silva, Alexandre Silva, and Tiago Hirth, got our book "Magic, Mathematics, and Playing Cards" published. In this five minute presentation I aim to share four quick effects to hook the audience in wanting to know more about the mathematics that make them work to promote our work.

			Brigitte Stenhouse: From Sanskrit to Nepali: The mathematical poetry of the Dhananjayas
		</h4>
		<p>
			In the early twentieth century, two Nepali translations were published of Lilavati, a classic Sanskrit maths text. Despite the attribution of one text to Chandrakala Dhananjaya and the other to her husband, Tikaram, the books’ contents reveal that both authors contributed to both texts. In the absence of further documentary evidence, we explore why collaboration was needed to translate Sanskrit mathematical poetry into Nepali. This talk is based on research by Dr Deepak Basyal.

			Jørn Hafver: Rock Rock Paper Rock Scissors Paper
		</h4>
		<p>
			This is one of a pair of talks about mathematical magic tricks that we saw and fiddled with at this years G4G Europe. This one is a variation of a binary code trick to guess a number, and the result is what happens when someone says “could this be done in base 3?”. Rock paper and scissors are used to encode the numbers, and the challenge is to figure out how it works.

		Laurence O'Toole: K(Not) String Theory
	</h4>
	<p>
		Rational tangles are a way to represent any fraction using two lengths of rope. They were first introduced and studied by John Conway. Every implementation seems to use two standard moves for manipulating the ends of the rope, while also relying on four helpers who have been pre-trained in how to do these. Here, we will show that with eight Lego mini-figures, pre-training is not necessary, and there are an additional nine building blocks for how to move.

	<h4>
		Anindya Sharma: The Shape of Our Notes
	</h4>
	<p>
		I was with two mathematician friends of mine, and we started comparing how we structure our maths notes on our computers. Specifically, the directory structures. This got us thinking: could we quantify the shape of our thinking? Could we come up with metrics to see how differently we all approached our work? As we sketched out our own folder structures, a nice pattern emerged. We were all on a spectrum, and the two extremes were always the same two shapes: the Path Graph and the Star Graph. Instantly, we had a new language. "Oh, you're very path-like in how you approach problem solving," or "That's a very star-like way to organize a course." Maths is a great place to pick up some good vocabulary and metaphors for life, e.g. "progress is not monotonic", "the tasks on my to-do list do not commute". I believe "path-like" and "star-like" can be just as useful, and discuss a few examples.

		Gavan Fantom: Using maths to bend the world to your will
	</h4>
	<p>
		Much of the history of maths is intertwined with its use as a language to describe how the real world works. But why stop there, when we can also use maths to define how we want the world to work, and to make it so? We take a look at the fascinating world of control theory, what it means to be in control, and how to analyse and understand some of the properties of the resulting systems.

		Simon Allen: Did the dissection of triangle to a square originate with H. E. Dudeney

		The talk looked at the origin of the dissection of a well-known puzzle known as the Haberdashers' problem. It requires the dissection of an equilateral triangle into a square in the fewest number of pieces. It was proposed by H. E. Dudeney and appeared in the Daily Mail in a puzzle column in February 1905. He published the solution, but some years later, he gave credit to another.

			<h4>
				Miles Gould: Dual numbers
			</h4>
			<p>
				Like the complex numbers, the dual numbers are 2D vectors of real numbers with a rule that allows you to multiply them together. But the multiplication rule is different - instead of i² = -1, we have ε² = 0. This means that the "imaginary" part of a dual number behaves like an infinitesimal difference, and obeys the chain and product rules for derivatives. This is behind the magical-seeming trick of automatic differentiation, which makes training modern deep neural networks feasible.

			Fredrik Motland Kirkemo: New advances in the field of clown studies
		</h4>
		<p>
			This is one of a pair of talks about mathematical magic tricks that we saw and fiddled with at this years G4G Europe. This one is about a set of clown cards where every clown is wearing different coloured clothes. When we first saw this trick the clowns had four different coloured pieces of clothing. We thought it proper to give them a bit more to wear, so we extended the trick, so our clowns have six pieces of clothing. The cards are constructed in such a way that the cards themselves reveal the colours of all the different pieces of clothing a secretly selected clown was wearing.

You can represent this fact by arranging one 1 by 1 square, two 2 by 2 squares, three 2 by 2 squares, and so on up to nine 9 by 9 squares inside a 45 by 45 square. This talk looked at the general puzzle involving the sum of the first n cubes, showing that it's possible to do the arrangement for n=1, n=8 and n=9, but not possible for 2 to 7, and showed off <a href="https://www.mscroggs.co.uk/squares/">the interactive thing that Scroggs made</a>.

			Kristin Ohlmann: Optimizing the street safety of a unicycle through maths-inspired decorations
		</h4>
		<p>
			As a child, I often decorated my unicycle by threading crepe paper through the spokes. When I recently wanted to increase my unicycle's visibility, I figured that must also work with reflective rope. For decorative purposes, I wanted to alternate between different colours of rope. Given that the wheel is a circle, the obvious choice for the pattern was of course dictated by the digits of the circle constant... but which one? Using slightly questionable python code, I analyzed which constant's digits would give me a higher proportion of reflective rope, depending on wheel size and rope thickness.

			Vanessa Madu: On Sequences of Semiprimes
		</h4>
		<p>
			I explored sequences of consecutive odd semi-primes: numbers with exactly two (not necessarily distinct) prime factors. While the maximum length of sequences of consecutive semi-primes is a fairly widely known result, I wondered what would happen if we restricted to the odd-only case. By systematically searching, I found chains of lengths 2 through 8, but none longer, and for good reason. In any run of nine or more consecutive odd numbers, one must be divisible by 9, which means it contains the factor 3×3, and so it can’t be semi-prime. Therefore, the longest possible chain of consecutive odd semi-primes is of length eight. The talk also touched on why the smallest example of the longest chain isn’t the largest and posed some questions about generalising to other spacings between semi-primes.

		If you glue a Square based pyramid (S) and a Triangular based pyramid (T) together at one of the triangular faces, the resulting shape still has just five faces! How is this possible? What's more, the volume of S is exactly twice that of T. This talk demonstrates two ways to see this result simply and intuitively (no trig!).

		Nancy Blachman: Mathematical Magic
	</h4>
	<p>
		Mathematical magic has its own curious charm. It delights, confounds, and entices audiences to think about how the trick works. I presented a trick called "Cat, Dog, and Mouse Magic" and a variation of it. The beauty of this trick is that it can be accomplished in multiple ways. After I demonstrate my method, spectators are eager to stage it themselves. When they perform the trick, they inadvertently practice and develop their mathematical skills. For the Cat, Dog, and Mouse Magic cards and a video or two of the magic trick, visit <a href="jrmf.org/puzzle/cat-dog-mouse-magic/">jrmf.org/puzzle/cat-dog-mouse-magic/</a>.
