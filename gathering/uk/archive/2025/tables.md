title: MathsJam Gathering 2025 - Saturday Night Tables
---

For the Saturday evening session at MathsJam, attendees are running activities on tables in the Gathering main room. Some of them have sent through information so remote attendees can also participate - details are below. Don't forget there's also a board games table and a craft table to meet up with other Jammers during the evening in Gather.town!

More details will be added below shortly.

### Craft Table (Karen Hancock)

Come and craft with us. Usually fibre craft based, but all crafts welcome. We'll also join the Gather.town space from a laptop on the craft table, and sit at the virtual craft table there, so people can chat to those joining remotely.

### I Board Games Table

This table will not be led by anyone, but if you'd like to bring or play any board games (mathematical or otherwise!), this is a good place to do that.
